            EU – U.S. PRIVACY SHIELD AND SWISS – U.S. PRIVACY SHIELD
            We participate in and have certified our compliance with the EU – U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. We are committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries and Switzerland, respectively, in reliance on each Privacy Shield Frameworks, to the Framework’s applicable Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Frameworks, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List at https://www.privacyshield.gov/list.

            Under the Privacy Shield Framework, we are responsible for the processing of personal data that we collect from you and subsequently transfer to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf. We comply with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland including the onward transfer liability provisions.

            With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, we are subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including requests made to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

            If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.

            Under certain conditions more fully described on the Privacy Shield website (https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint) you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.

            PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT AT YOUR DIRECTION
            We may collect an individual’s information under the direction of one our customers, but we have no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data is controlled by our customers. The use of your information collected through your use or a customer’s services shall be limited to the purpose of providing the Services for which you or that customer engaged tailoredlabs.org.

            Our obligations with respect to personal data for which we are the data processor, such as personal data that you may store or transfer using the Services, are defined in our agreements for use of the Services and are not included in this Privacy Policy. You remain responsible for the personal data that you collect and process and for compliance with applicable data protection laws. If you would no longer like to be contacted or if you have any questions about how one our customers uses your personal data, please contact them directly. Additionally, we may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our Services. Our obligations regarding transfers to third parties are covered in our agreements for use of the Services and are not included in this Privacy Policy.

            PERSONAL DATA YOU PROVIDE TO US
            In order for you to use our Services and other features of our Site, we will ask you for some of your personal data (e.g. contact information, name, etc.). The amount and type of information that we gather depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who would like to comment on our blog to provide a username. Those who purchase Services from us are asked to provide additional information including, as necessary, the personal and financial information required to process transactions. In each case, we collect such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with us. We do not disclose personal data other than as described below. You can always refuse to supply personal data, however, doing so may prevent you from receiving our Services and may prevent you from engaging in other activities on the Site. In no event will we ever gather sensitive personal data (e.g. health information, religious preferences, etc.) from you, and we expressly request that you not provide any such sensitive personal data to us in any free-text fields that are present on the Site.

            PASSIVE COLLECTION
            As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the site. We use analytical software to help us understand this information. This software sends information to its licensor. Other sites and companies may also use this software. As a result, the licensor may collect information that, when aggregated by them, allows them to identify you individually. We have no responsibility for this collection and use.

            COOKIES & OTHER TECHNOLOGIES ON THE SITE
            We and our partners use cookies and similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements around the Site, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.

            INFORMATION SHARING
            We disclose personal data only to our employees and third parties (such as the service providers that need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf or to help provide the Services) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. These employee or third party provided services may include:

            Payment processing
            Providing customer service
            Sending marketing communications
            Conducting research and analysis
            Providing cloud computing infrastructure
            Some of the employees or third parties providing these services may be located outside of your home country (e.g. in the United States). By using the Site or signing up for the Services you consent to the transfer of your information to them.

            We will not rent or sell personal data to anyone other than in conjunction with the sale of our business. Other than described in this Privacy Policy, we disclose personal data only when required to do so by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process. When we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (i) protect our property or other rights, protect the property or other rights of third parties, or protect the public at large; (ii) investigate fraud; or (iii) respond to a government request.

            If you are our customer, we will occasionally send you emails to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or keep you up to date with what is going on at tailoredlabs.org. If you send us a request (for example, via a support email or one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. We own all such feedback.

            CHANGING INFORMATION

An individual who seeks to access, correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data maintained by one of our customers should direct their query to that customer acting as the data controller. If you request to remove data we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.

            We may keep your personal information and the data we process on your behalf as covered by this Privacy Policy for as long as needed to provide the Services to you or for a period of twelve months from the date you terminate your relationship with us.

We encourage you to frequently check this page for any changes to our Privacy Policy. If we make a change to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by e-mail (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account, if applicable) or by means of a notice on our Site prior to the change becoming effective. All such changes are effective at the time set out in our notice. If you disagree with such a change, you may discontinue use of the Services or Site.

            APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES
            We have put in place reasonable measures and appropriate procedures for implementing these policies and for safeguarding the information we collect from you.
